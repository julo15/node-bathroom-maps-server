To start the database:

    sudo mongod --dbpath <path>

    On test machine, dbpath is ~/Documents/mongo/data/db

    Need to sudo for some access issues

To start the app:

    node app.js

    The node app is configured to always use the mongodb on 127.0.0.1:27017
    By default, the node app uses the 'test' db. On prod, we indeed use the 'test' db.

To backup/restore the database:

    mongoexport --db test --collection bathrooms --out bathrooms.json --host 127.0.0.1:27017
    mongoimport --db test --collection bathrooms --drop --file bathrooms.json --host 127.0.0.1:27017

    We are storing everything today into the bathrooms collection.
    When reviews get moved out of the bathrooms collection, we'll need to export that too.

To run tests:
